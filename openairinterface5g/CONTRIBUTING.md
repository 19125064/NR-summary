# Contributing to OpenAirInterface #

We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible.

Please refer to the steps described on our website: [How to contribute to OAI](https://www.openairinterface.org/?page_id=112)

1. Sign and return a Contributor License Agreement to OAI team.
2. Create an account on [Eurecom GitLab Server](https://gitlab.eurecom.fr).
3. Provide the identifiant of this account to the OAI team (mailto:contact@openairinterface.org) so you have developer rights on this repository.
4. The policies are described in these wiki pages: [OAI Policies](https://gitlab.eurecom.fr/oai/openairinterface5g/wikis/oai-policies-home)
   -  PLEASE DO NOT FORK the OAI repository on your own Eurecom GitLab account. It just eats up space on our servers.
   - You can fork onto another hosting system. But we will NOT accept a merge request from a forked repository.
      * This decision was made for the license reasons.
      * The Continuous Integration will reject your merge request.
   - All merge requests SHALL have `develop` branch as target branch.
